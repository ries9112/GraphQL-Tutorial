<h2>APIs Introduction</h2>
<p>An API is a tool that helps share data/information with anyone. APIs are frequently created by companies to allow developers to create software that allows users to interact with their services. Some are more complex than others, so for the purposes of this tutorial <strong>we will only use APIs that require no authentication</strong>.</p>
<p>The word API stands for <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>I</strong>nterface. APIs are meant to be accessible regardless of the programming language used. The data can be accessed through a URL the same way you would access a website, but typically returns very light text in the JSON format, which we will have to then manipulate to a format that works better in R and Python which will look like a data table with rows and columns. APIs provide a way for anyone to interact with a service through code, which can be as simple as pulling some data, or more complex, for example to programmatically trigger a trade on a cryptocurrency exchange. APIs are used by a large number of entities for different purposes, for example the US government provides data that anyone can perform research on: <a href="https://www.data.gov/developers/apis" class="uri">https://www.data.gov/developers/apis</a> (which we will not use in this tutorial because it requires the user to request a free API “key” to authenticate).</p>
<!-- To give another concrete example of an API, Strava - add this example? Discussing how you can use their app to track your progress, or create your own reports - could give example using blog post shared on the R Strava group, but obviously would need to keep that part of the code hidden if posting to GitHub -->
<div id="section-api-usage" class="section level3">
<h3>API Usage</h3>
<!-- If needed, list of postman public endpoints that do not require authentication: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/Szf7znEe -->
<p>Let’s start with a simple example relating to the TV show Game of Thrones. We can get information relating to the different houses by navigating to this url: <a href="https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses" class="uri">https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses</a></p>
<p>The webpage is shown below:</p>
<iframe src="https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses" width="624" height="400px">
</iframe>
<p>In order to get this information into R or another programming language, we will need to perform a <strong><em>GET</em></strong> request to retrieve the data from the url above. We can use the <code>httr</code> <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=httr"><span class="citation">(Wickham 2020)</span></a> package and use the <strong><code>GET</code></strong> function to receive data from the API:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(httr)
api_request &lt;- GET(&quot;https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Using a GET request we can retrieve the data that we are interested in. APIs also sometimes allow users to make <strong>POST</strong> requests which allows the user to <strong>send</strong> data to the service rather than receiving it. Doing a POST requires the user to be authenticated, so in this tutorial we will only be doing GET requests using public API <em>endpoints</em>. An endpoint being a url like the one we used above.</p>
<p>If we view the result of the GET request we made, we will see a summary of the results of the request rather than the results themselves:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>api_request</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Response [https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses]
##   Date: 2021-01-06 16:26
##   Status: 200
##   Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
##   Size: 7.11 kB</code></pre>
<p>The result <strong><code>Status: 200</code></strong> indicates our request was successful. If the request we made was not successful, we would get a different status code, and we could write the logic in our code accordingly to deal with these outcomes. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">this link for a full list of typical status codes and what they would mean</a>.</p>
<p>Because we are interested in the actual content of the request, we can use the function <code>content()</code> from the <code>httr</code> package on the API request we made and retrieve the text of the content:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get the data from the url
example_data &lt;- content(api_request, as=&#39;text&#39;)
# show the data in its raw format (not yet usable)
example_data</code></pre>

You’ll do much more than just write code - you’ll be an integral part of the entire digital product development process, from ideation through delivery and iteration.<\/p>\\n<p>You’ll work on our Digital team, made up of folks across growth, design, and engineering, to drive our business forward and bring Parade to hundreds of thousands of people across the United States over the next year. This role reports to the Head of Engineering and will work closely with both them and our current engineer.<\/p>\\n<p>Our Stack &amp; Process:\\nNew frontend projects typically start with a set of Figma designs, coupled with detailed interaction notes, which we’d hand off to you.

Rigado’s products meet this need.<\/p>\\n<p>Join us as we develop and evolve our edge platform to monitor end-devices, load balance sensor data collection across multiple edge compute nodes and continue to make our system more stable and robust.<\/p>\\n<h3>How we do in engineering:<\/h3>\\n<p>Curiosity, empathy, ownership, and collaboration underline our work. We like strong opinions, weakly held. If you're eager to both learn from and teach fellow engineers and non-engineers alike, build excellent products for our customers, and dive headfirst into unfamiliar technology, approaches, and challenges, please be in touch.<\/p>\\n<h3>The tech details:<\/h3>\\n<p>We're building a distributed system, primarily in Go, to manage devices on the edge. Our systems must function effectively in the absence of a reliable connection between the server and the client.

No experience with the other the areas of engineering required for this software position but it is a bonus.<\/p>\\n<p>We've also got some of the standard hopes and dreams of a senior backend engineer job posting:<\/p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Experience designing and building distributed systems<\/li>\\n<li>Experience with a non-relational database such as DynamoDB<\/li>\\n<li>Familiarity with AWS services or other cloud vendors<\/li>\\n<li>Commitment to writing stable and maintainable software that's tested, documented, and has a barest minimum of TODOs<\/li>\\n<li>Understanding of how to use metrics, monitoring, and alerting to ensure system health<\/li>\\n<li>Experience with operations and hosting services you build<\/li>\\n<li>Experience in Go is a plus but not a requirement<\/li>\\n<li>Understanding of networking (OSI, TLS, HTTP)<\/li>\\n<li>Familiarity with Linux (embedded or otherwise)<\/li>\\n<li>Experience with Docker or other container technology<\/li>\\n<\/ul>\\n<p>Most importantly, we're looking for someone who is excited to learn and tackle new challenges, is motivated to be a valued colleague, is not afraid to ask for help, and doesn't hesitate to provide help. This is a lot exciting stuff coming down the pike so there's a lot of room to help shape the future of software at Rigado and of IoT device management generally.<\/p>\\n<h3>The people details:<\/h3>\\n<p>We're building a team in addition to software, and we value and seek inclusion and diversity in that team. We're not thrilled to be representative of the state of the industry at the moment and are committed to pushing a sea change on that front.

<p>When we are interested in a specific subset of the data, there are usually ways to modify the request to return the data we need. For example, rather than returning all job postings we could make a request to only get jobs with the location set to New York. To do this, we can add the text <code>?location=new+york</code> to the url of the API request:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Modify the url for the API request for New York location
url &lt;- paste0(url, &quot;?location=new+york&quot;)
# Get the data from the url and convert to dataframe
github_jobs_nyc &lt;- fromJSON(content(GET(url), as=&#39;text&#39;))
# Show data
github_jobs_nyc</code></pre>

De Front-end developers ontwikkelen zoveel als mogelijk in React.<\/li>\\n<\/ul>\\n<p><strong>Waar kom je te werken?<\/strong>\\nDe afdeling Onderzoek, Informatie en Statistiek (OIS) van gemeente Amsterdam verzamelt data over Amsterdam en verwerkt deze tot informatie. Van onderwerpen als de Amsterdamse bevolking, de woningvoorraad, de werkgelegenheid en de bedrijvigheid in de stad tot onderwerpen als veiligheid, verkiezingen, zorg en onderwijs. Ook ontwikkelt en beheert OIS de gemeentelijke datavoorziening DataPunt waarmee data en dataproducten beschikbaar zijn voor gemeente en publiek.<\/p>\\n<p>Zo biedt de website Data en Informatie verschillende mogelijkheden om aan de slag te gaan met de beschikbare gegevens <a href=\"https://www.data.amsterdam.nl\">www.data.amsterdam.nl<\/a>, en werkt team Data Services aan een generieke manier waarmee databronnen worden verwerkt en beschikbaar worden gesteld. Denk aan slimme verkeersroutes dankzij onderzoek met behulp van tijdelijke kentekencamera's, met machine learning meldingen openbare ruimte doorgeleiden of data-analyse om de kortste afstanden tot afval containers te berekenen. Hierbij maken we gebruik van zowel bewezen als nieuwe methodes en technieken. Denk aan Machine Learning oplossingen om stadsarchieven te indexeren of straatafval te herkennen, REST APIs en GraphQL voor dataontsluiting en Docker om onze applicaties in de cloud (migratie naar Microsoft Azure) te draaien. Bij ontwikkeling gaan we uit van “Open Source tenzij\". Zodoende hebben we inmiddels bijna 230 publieke Github repositories online staan.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>Dit breng je mee<\/strong>\\nAl onze collega’s verschillen.

<p>Notice that on our end we do not need to worry about storing any information or creating any infrastructure, for example we do not need to worry about the difficulties that may come with storing a large amount of images and data, we can simply retrieve specifically what we need.</p>
<p>Towards the end of this tutorial you will learn about a newer technology that is similar to APIs called <strong>GraphQL</strong> which not only allows the user to specify the subset of the data they want to retrieve, but also allows the user to specify which fields to return for the request. For example, if we were only interested in displaying the company logos for the job listings, rather than pulling all of the fields associated with the API request we could be more efficient and create a request that only gives the one field. Before learning how to connect to and use a GraphQL endpoint, move on to the next section to get more practice using regular APIs, this time in the context of collecting prices from the cryptocurrency markets.</p>

<h2>Cryptocurrency Data Examples</h2>
<div id="section-price-of-bitcoin" class="section level3">
<h3>Price of Bitcoin</h3>
<p>There are several free APIs we can use to retrieve cryptocurrency prices.</p>
<p>As a first example, let’s get the latest price of Bitcoin according to the website coindesk.com from the url: <a href="https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json" class="uri">https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json</a></p>
<!-- One more example, crypto data: -->
<!-- https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json -->
<pre class="r"><code>url &lt;- &quot;https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json&quot;
# Get the data from the url
bitcoin_price &lt;- content(GET(url), as=&#39;text&#39;)
# Convert from JSON to dataframe
bitcoin_price &lt;- fromJSON(bitcoin_price)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can show the current price of Bitcoin in USD:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bitcoin_price$bpi$USD$rate</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;34,919.7267&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And when the price was last updated:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bitcoin_price$time$updated</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Jan 6, 2021 16:26:00 UTC&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-hitbtc-exchange" class="section level3">
<h3>HitBTC Exchange</h3>
<p>The price we showed for Bitcoin is a simplified way of thinking of the price of a cryptocurrency and was the average price across many exchanges. In reality though, the market on an individual exchange is more complicated than a single price, and is instead made up of constantly evolving orders of people who are looking to buy and people who are looking to sell. Users submit their orders to the <strong>order book</strong> and the exchange takes care of filling orders matching buyers and sellers based on their designated price. We can use the API for the <a href="https://hitbtc.com/">HitBTC exchange</a> to return the 100 most favorable prices on each side of the current order book for Bitcoin (using the BTC/USD trading pair):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>url &lt;- &quot;https://api.hitbtc.com/api/2/public/orderbook/BTCUSD&quot;
# Get the data from the url
orderbook &lt;- content(GET(url), as=&#39;text&#39;)
# Convert from JSON to dataframe
orderbook &lt;- fromJSON(orderbook)
# Show the new data

<p>We can think of the intersection between the <code>ask</code> and the <code>bid</code> prices available on the orderbook as the current price. Going back to the example from earlier with Bitcoin’s price, we have now seen that this is a bit of a construct because the price of Bitcoin not only depends on the individual exchange, but in practice there is a difference between the price you can purchase Bitcoin at and the price you can sell it for. Because Bitcoin has a large amount of liquidity, this difference tends to be intangible, but if trading other cryptocurrencies with less volume, this can become a meaningful difference.</p>

<!-- ## Python Example - COMMENTED OUT BECAUSE REQUEST PACKAGE NOT FOUND-->
<!-- Making an API request in Python involves the same steps that we have outlined up to this point using R, and would just involve a different set of tools. -->
<!-- For an API request in Python you can use the [**`requests`** library](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/): -->
<!-- ```{python py_make_request} -->
<!-- import requests -->
<!-- # Make an API request -->
<!-- python_request = requests.get("https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/coins/btc-bitcoin/exchanges") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Like before, if we call the result we will get a summary of our request, where a code of **`200`** is a successful request: -->
<!-- ```{python py_show_request} -->
<!-- python_request -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Meaning, we need to actually extract the JSON data out of our request: -->
<!-- ```{python py_json_parse} -->
<!-- python_request = python_request.json() -->
<!-- # Show the data in the json format: -->
<!-- python_request -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Now we can use [**`pandas`**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to convert the data to a dataframe: -->
<!-- ```{python py_req_to_pandas} -->
<!-- import pandas as pd -->
<!-- python_request = pd.DataFrame(python_request) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Now we can view the results (shown from R to improve the format): -->
<!-- ```{r show_python_request} -->
<!-- py$python_request -->
<!-- ``` -->
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-graphql" class="section level2">
<h2>GraphQL</h2>
<p>In all of the previous examples we made specific requests to different URLs to return some data. When making the request, if we are only interested in returning one field, for example only the company logo from the GitHub job board, we would have to request a lot of redundant information to get to the single piece of information that we are interested in.</p>
<p>GraphQL helps solve this problem, and allows for a company/entity to provide an API where the user is able to specify the specific fields they want to return when making their API request, which, depending on the specific situation, can be much more efficient for both the developer of the API and the user.</p>
<div id="section-graphql-example" class="section level3">
<h3>GraphQL Example</h3>
<!-- TODO - Introduce SpaceX example and interactive explorer -->
<p>The company SpaceX offers a public GraphQL endpoint: <a href="https://api.spacex.land/graphql/" class="uri">https://api.spacex.land/graphql/</a> - embedded below:</p>
<iframe src="https://api.spacex.land/graphql/" width="100%" height="400px">
</iframe>
<p>Rather than making requests to multiple API endpoints and manipulating the data to create the dataset that is needed, GraphQL gives the user a lot more flexibility and precision for the data to return. In the link embedded above, you can use the <em>Explorer</em> on the left side of the page and use the checkboxes to decide which endpoints and columns from those endpoints to include. The middle section displays the code to use to make the GraphQL request based on the selections made. Once the play button is clicked, the query is executed and the latest results are displayed on the right side of the page. We can use the query created and displayed in the middle section of the page to create the same request using R.</p>
<p>First, we will import the package <strong><code>ghql</code></strong> which will allow us to interact with a GraphQL endpoint:</p>
<!-- TODO - ADD REFERENCE TO ghql -->
<pre class="r"><code># GraphQL R client (https://github.com/ropensci/ghql)
library(ghql)</code></pre>
<p>Next, we want to establish a connection with the GraphQL endpoint:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>con &lt;- GraphqlClient$new(
  url = &quot;https://api.spacex.land/graphql/&quot;
)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can send a query to the GraphQL endpoint using the example given at <a href="https://api.spacex.land/graphql/" class="uri">https://api.spacex.land/graphql/</a>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Initialize empty query
qry &lt;- Query$new()
# Example Query
qry$query(&#39;mydata&#39;, &#39;{
  launchesPast(order: &quot;launch_date_local&quot;) {
    mission_name
    launch_date_local
    launch_site {
      site_name
      site_name_long
    }
    links {
      article_link
      video_link
    }
  }
}&#39;)
# Query to object
spacex_data &lt;- con$exec(qry$queries$mydata)</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the results from the request, it will once again be in the JSON format, so like before we can convert the JSON format to a dataframe using the <code>fromJSON</code> function from the <code>jsonlite</code> package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>spacex_data &lt;- fromJSON(spacex_data)</code></pre>
<p>The data we retrieved this time has a strange <strong><em>nested</em></strong> structure, where we have a column like <code>links</code> which currently contains both the <code>article_link</code> and <code>video_link</code> columns. Because of this, the <code>fromJSON</code> function will return a list object instead of the expected dataframe. We can clean this up into a workable format by first using the <code>as_tibble()</code> function to convert the list to a tibble (which has similar properties to a dataframe, <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html">find out more here</a>), and using the <code>unnest()</code> function on the new result:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>spacex_data &lt;- unnest(as_tibble(spacex_data))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: `cols` is now required when using unnest().
## Please use `cols = c(data)`</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Show data:
spacex_data</code></pre>
