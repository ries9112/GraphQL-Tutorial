<h2>APIs Introduction</h2>
<p>An API is a tool that helps share data/information with anyone. APIs are frequently created by companies to allow developers to create software that allows users to interact with their services. Some are more complex than others, so for the purposes of this tutorial <strong>we will only use APIs that require no authentication</strong>.</p>
<p>The word API stands for <strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>P</strong>rogramming <strong>I</strong>nterface. APIs are meant to be accessible regardless of the programming language used. The data can be accessed through a URL the same way you would access a website, but typically returns very light text in the JSON format, which we will have to then manipulate to a format that works better in R and Python which will look like a data table with rows and columns. APIs provide a way for anyone to interact with a service through code, which can be as simple as pulling some data, or more complex, for example to programmatically trigger a trade on a cryptocurrency exchange. APIs are used by a large number of entities for different purposes, for example the US government provides data that anyone can perform research on: <a href="https://www.data.gov/developers/apis" class="uri">https://www.data.gov/developers/apis</a> (which we will not use in this tutorial because it requires the user to request a free API “key” to authenticate).</p>
<!-- To give another concrete example of an API, Strava - add this example? Discussing how you can use their app to track your progress, or create your own reports - could give example using blog post shared on the R Strava group, but obviously would need to keep that part of the code hidden if posting to GitHub -->
<div id="section-api-usage" class="section level3">
<h3>API Usage</h3>
<!-- If needed, list of postman public endpoints that do not require authentication: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/Szf7znEe -->
<p>Let’s start with a simple example relating to the TV show Game of Thrones. We can get information relating to the different houses by navigating to this url: <a href="https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses" class="uri">https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses</a></p>
<p>The webpage is shown below:</p>
<iframe src="https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses" width="624" height="400px">
</iframe>
<p>In order to get this information into R or another programming language, we will need to perform a <strong><em>GET</em></strong> request to retrieve the data from the url above. We can use the <code>httr</code> <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=httr"><span class="citation">(Wickham 2020)</span></a> package and use the <strong><code>GET</code></strong> function to receive data from the API:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(httr)
api_request &lt;- GET(&quot;https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Using a GET request we can retrieve the data that we are interested in. APIs also sometimes allow users to make <strong>POST</strong> requests which allows the user to <strong>send</strong> data to the service rather than receiving it. Doing a POST requires the user to be authenticated, so in this tutorial we will only be doing GET requests using public API <em>endpoints</em>. An endpoint being a url like the one we used above.</p>
<p>If we view the result of the GET request we made, we will see a summary of the results of the request rather than the results themselves:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>api_request</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Response [https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses]
##   Date: 2021-01-13 16:47
##   Status: 200
##   Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
##   Size: 7.11 kB</code></pre>
<p>The result <strong><code>Status: 200</code></strong> indicates our request was successful. If the request we made was not successful, we would get a different status code, and we could write the logic in our code accordingly to deal with these outcomes. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status">this link for a full list of typical status codes and what they would mean</a>.</p>
<p>Because we are interested in the actual content of the request, we can use the function <code>content()</code> from the <code>httr</code> package on the API request we made and retrieve the text of the content:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Get the data from the url
example_data &lt;- content(api_request, as=&#39;text&#39;)
# show the data in its raw format (not yet usable)
example_data</code></pre>

Je adviseert teams en daagt hen uit het maximale uit het platform te halen. Jij kunt in deze rol je passie helemaal kwijt als het aankomt op het zien van nieuwe kansen om werk en testen te automatiseren. Daarin staat vakmanschap bij jou voorop! Je komt te werken in een modern Agile ingericht IT landschap waar we continu bezig zijn met verbeteren en waar we van innoveren houden.

Naast samenwerken krijg je veel zelfstandigheid en de ruimte om je eigen ding(en) te doen.<\/li>\\n<li>Je gaat werken aan een aantal actuele projecten en thema’s als het opzetten van een schaalbare Azure DevOps agent pool in Azure, het upgraden van de Elastic stack en het uitbreiden van de mogelijkheden en het onderzoeken van de inzet van Azure DevTest labs voor gebruik binnen PGGM.<\/li>\\n<\/ul>\\n<p><strong>Leonard Trimp – Product Owner IT4IT :<em>“Voor mijn start bij PGGM had ik niet verwacht dat wij hier zo’n verrassend modern en innovatief IT landschap zouden hebben en dat er zulke gave dingen gedaan worden.”<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\\n<p><strong>Jouw afdeling binnen PGGM<\/strong>\\nIn opdracht van onze klanten (pensioenfondsen) verzorgen wij met 1.500 collega’s de pensioenadministratie voor 4,4 miljoen Nederlanders, van wie er 2,8 miljoen werken in de sector Zorg en Welzijn. Met een beheerd vermogen van 252 miljard euro, behoren we tot de grootse institutionele beleggers ter wereld. Om aan de specifieke klantvragen te kunnen voldoen, passen wij onze business- en IT-processen hier zo goed mogelijk op aan. Binnen PB-IT ontwikkelen meer dan 25+ teams gezamenlijk de systemen en applicaties waarin de medewerkers van Pensioenbeheer hun werk doen.

Onder andere ontwikkelservers, build- en testagents en andere tooling noodzakelijk voor systeemontwikkeling en beheer (Azure DevOps, Azure, Elastic, Containerization, XL Deploy, ProGet, Chocolatey etc). De uitdaging van IT4IT is om met nieuwe tools, technieken en automatiseringsslagen het ontwikkelplatform zo te verbeteren dat het voortbrengingsproces van de andere teams vereenvoudigt, versnelt en kwalitatief beter maakt. Hierbij zoeken we continu de balans tussen beheer en nieuwe functionaliteiten. Zo zijn we druk bezig met onze strategie om het platform naar Azure te brengen en moeten we daarbij ons on premise landschap niet uit het oog verliezen. We hebben binnen PGGM een Microsoft landschap, maar maken ook gebruik van andere leveranciers en open source.<\/p>\\n<p>We zijn een team van gepassioneerde collega’s die met plezier en humor samenwerken aan een professioneel platform met een hoog niveau van automatisering.

Our open digital payments platform gives PayPal’s 305 million active account holders the confidence to connect and transact in new and powerful ways, whether they are online, on a mobile device, in an app, or in person. Through a combination of technological innovation and strategic partnerships, PayPal creates better ways to manage and move money, and offers choice and flexibility when sending payments, paying or getting paid. Available in more than 200 markets around the world, the PayPal platform, including Braintree, Venmo and Xoom enables consumers and merchants to receive money in more than 100 currencies, withdraw funds in 56 currencies and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 25 currencies.<\/p>\\n<p>The Commerce Solutions and Services Engineering (CSSE) team is responsible for building solutions and platforms used by all PayPal’s merchants, focusing on the largest customers – the Enterprise, Channel Partners and Marketplaces customer segments.

These platforms combined are responsible for processing more than half of PayPal’s transactions worldwide, so this is a high-stakes role – there are very few mission critical APIs like this in the world, with this kind of scale and complexity, and that power so much commerce and so many businesses worldwide.

<p>When we are interested in a specific subset of the data, there are usually ways to modify the request to return the data we need. For example, rather than returning all job postings we could make a request to only get jobs with the location set to New York. To do this, we can add the text <code>?location=new+york</code> to the url of the API request:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Modify the url for the API request for New York location
url &lt;- paste0(url, &quot;?location=new+york&quot;)
# Get the data from the url and convert to dataframe
github_jobs_nyc &lt;- fromJSON(content(GET(url), as=&#39;text&#39;))
# Show data
github_jobs_nyc</code></pre>

De Front-end developers ontwikkelen zoveel als mogelijk in React.<\/li>\\n<\/ul>\\n<p><strong>Waar kom je te werken?<\/strong>\\nDe afdeling Onderzoek, Informatie en Statistiek (OIS) van gemeente Amsterdam verzamelt data over Amsterdam en verwerkt deze tot informatie. Van onderwerpen als de Amsterdamse bevolking, de woningvoorraad, de werkgelegenheid en de bedrijvigheid in de stad tot onderwerpen als veiligheid, verkiezingen, zorg en onderwijs. Ook ontwikkelt en beheert OIS de gemeentelijke datavoorziening DataPunt waarmee data en dataproducten beschikbaar zijn voor gemeente en publiek.<\/p>\\n<p>Zo biedt de website Data en Informatie verschillende mogelijkheden om aan de slag te gaan met de beschikbare gegevens <a href=\"https://www.data.amsterdam.nl\">www.data.amsterdam.nl<\/a>, en werkt team Data Services aan een generieke manier waarmee databronnen worden verwerkt en beschikbaar worden gesteld. Denk aan slimme verkeersroutes dankzij onderzoek met behulp van tijdelijke kentekencamera's, met machine learning meldingen openbare ruimte doorgeleiden of data-analyse om de kortste afstanden tot afval containers te berekenen. Hierbij maken we gebruik van zowel bewezen als nieuwe methodes en technieken. Denk aan Machine Learning oplossingen om stadsarchieven te indexeren of straatafval te herkennen, REST APIs en GraphQL voor dataontsluiting en Docker om onze applicaties in de cloud (migratie naar Microsoft Azure) te draaien. Bij ontwikkeling gaan we uit van “Open Source tenzij\". Zodoende hebben we inmiddels bijna 230 publieke Github repositories online staan.<\/p>\\n<p><strong>Dit breng je mee<\/strong>\\nAl onze collega’s verschillen.

<p>Notice that on our end we do not need to worry about storing any information or creating any infrastructure, for example we do not need to worry about the difficulties that may come with storing a large amount of images and data, we can simply retrieve specifically what we need.</p>
<p>Towards the end of this tutorial you will learn about a newer technology that is similar to APIs called <strong>GraphQL</strong> which not only allows the user to specify the subset of the data they want to retrieve, but also allows the user to specify which fields to return for the request. For example, if we were only interested in displaying the company logos for the job listings, rather than pulling all of the fields associated with the API request we could be more efficient and create a request that only gives the one field. Before learning how to connect to and use a GraphQL endpoint, move on to the next section to get more practice using regular APIs, this time in the context of collecting prices from the cryptocurrency markets.</p>

<h2>Cryptocurrency Data Examples</h2>
<div id="section-price-of-bitcoin" class="section level3">
<h3>Price of Bitcoin</h3>
<p>There are several free APIs we can use to retrieve cryptocurrency prices.</p>
<p>As a first example, let’s get the latest price of Bitcoin according to the website coindesk.com from the url: <a href="https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json" class="uri">https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json</a></p>
<!-- One more example, crypto data: -->
<!-- https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json -->
<pre class="r"><code>url &lt;- &quot;https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json&quot;
# Get the data from the url
bitcoin_price &lt;- content(GET(url), as=&#39;text&#39;)
# Convert from JSON to dataframe
bitcoin_price &lt;- fromJSON(bitcoin_price)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can show the current price of Bitcoin in USD:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bitcoin_price$bpi$USD$rate</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;34,663.7683&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And when the price was last updated:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bitcoin_price$time$updated</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Jan 13, 2021 16:47:00 UTC&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="section-hitbtc-exchange" class="section level3">
<h3>HitBTC Exchange</h3>
<p>The price we showed for Bitcoin is a simplified way of thinking of the price of a cryptocurrency and was the average price across many exchanges. In reality though, the market on an individual exchange is more complicated than a single price, and is instead made up of constantly evolving orders of people who are looking to buy and people who are looking to sell. Users submit their orders to the <strong>order book</strong> and the exchange takes care of filling orders matching buyers and sellers based on their designated price. We can use the API for the <a href="https://hitbtc.com/">HitBTC exchange</a> to return the 100 most favorable prices on each side of the current order book for Bitcoin (using the BTC/USD trading pair):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>url &lt;- &quot;https://api.hitbtc.com/api/2/public/orderbook/BTCUSD&quot;
# Get the data from the url
orderbook &lt;- content(GET(url), as=&#39;text&#39;)
# Convert from JSON to dataframe
orderbook &lt;- fromJSON(orderbook)
# Show the new data

<p>We can think of the intersection between the <code>ask</code> and the <code>bid</code> prices available on the orderbook as the current price. Going back to the example from earlier with Bitcoin’s price, we have now seen that this is a bit of a construct because the price of Bitcoin not only depends on the individual exchange, but in practice there is a difference between the price you can purchase Bitcoin at and the price you can sell it for. Because Bitcoin has a large amount of liquidity, this difference tends to be intangible, but if trading other cryptocurrencies with less volume, this can become a meaningful difference.</p>

<!-- ## Python Example - COMMENTED OUT BECAUSE REQUEST PACKAGE NOT FOUND-->
<!-- Making an API request in Python involves the same steps that we have outlined up to this point using R, and would just involve a different set of tools. -->
<!-- For an API request in Python you can use the [**`requests`** library](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/): -->
<!-- ```{python py_make_request} -->
<!-- import requests -->
<!-- # Make an API request -->
<!-- python_request = requests.get("https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/coins/btc-bitcoin/exchanges") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Like before, if we call the result we will get a summary of our request, where a code of **`200`** is a successful request: -->
<!-- ```{python py_show_request} -->
<!-- python_request -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Meaning, we need to actually extract the JSON data out of our request: -->
<!-- ```{python py_json_parse} -->
<!-- python_request = python_request.json() -->
<!-- # Show the data in the json format: -->
<!-- python_request -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Now we can use [**`pandas`**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to convert the data to a dataframe: -->
<!-- ```{python py_req_to_pandas} -->
<!-- import pandas as pd -->
<!-- python_request = pd.DataFrame(python_request) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- Now we can view the results (shown from R to improve the format): -->
<!-- ```{r show_python_request} -->
<!-- py$python_request -->
<!-- ``` -->

<div id="section-graphql" class="section level2">
<h2>GraphQL</h2>
<p>In all of the previous examples we made specific requests to different URLs to return some data. When making the request, if we are only interested in returning one field, for example only the company logo from the GitHub job board, we would have to request a lot of redundant information to get to the single piece of information that we are interested in.</p>
<p>GraphQL helps solve this problem, and allows for a company/entity to provide an API where the user is able to specify the specific fields they want to return when making their API request, which, depending on the specific situation, can be much more efficient for both the developer of the API and the user.</p>
<div id="section-graphql-example" class="section level3">
<h3>GraphQL Example</h3>
<!-- TODO - Introduce SpaceX example and interactive explorer -->
<p>The company SpaceX offers a public GraphQL endpoint: <a href="https://api.spacex.land/graphql/" class="uri">https://api.spacex.land/graphql/</a> - embedded below:</p>
<iframe src="https://api.spacex.land/graphql/" width="100%" height="400px">
</iframe>
<p>Rather than making requests to multiple API endpoints and manipulating the data to create the dataset that is needed, GraphQL gives the user a lot more flexibility and precision for the data to return. In the link embedded above, you can use the <em>Explorer</em> on the left side of the page and use the checkboxes to decide which endpoints and columns from those endpoints to include. The middle section displays the code to use to make the GraphQL request based on the selections made. Once the play button is clicked, the query is executed and the latest results are displayed on the right side of the page. We can use the query created and displayed in the middle section of the page to create the same request using R.</p>
<p>First, we will import the package <strong><code>ghql</code></strong> which will allow us to interact with a GraphQL endpoint:</p>
<!-- TODO - ADD REFERENCE TO ghql -->
<pre class="r"><code># GraphQL R client (https://github.com/ropensci/ghql)
library(ghql)</code></pre>
<p>Next, we want to establish a connection with the GraphQL endpoint:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>con &lt;- GraphqlClient$new(
  url = &quot;https://api.spacex.land/graphql/&quot;
)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can send a query to the GraphQL endpoint using the example given at <a href="https://api.spacex.land/graphql/" class="uri">https://api.spacex.land/graphql/</a></p>
<p>First we need to create a new object with an empty query:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>graphql_request &lt;- Query$new()</code></pre>
<!-- *This object is a special ["class"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html) * -->
<p>Now we can build the request:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>graphql_request$query(&#39;mydata&#39;, &#39;{
  launchesPast(order: &quot;launch_date_local&quot;) {
    mission_name
    launch_date_local
    launch_site {
      site_name
      site_name_long
    }
    links {
      article_link
      video_link
    }
  }
}&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Finally we can execute the query using <code>con$exec()</code> on the request we built above and assign the results to the <code>spacex_data</code> object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>spacex_data &lt;- con$exec(graphql_request$queries$mydata)</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the results from the request, it will once again be in the JSON format, so like before we can convert the JSON format to a dataframe using the <code>fromJSON</code> function from the <code>jsonlite</code> package:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>spacex_data &lt;- fromJSON(spacex_data)</code></pre>
<p>The data we retrieved this time has a strange <strong><em>nested</em></strong> structure, where we have a column like <code>links</code> which currently contains both the <code>article_link</code> and <code>video_link</code> columns. Because of this, the <code>fromJSON</code> function will return a list object instead of the expected dataframe. We can clean this up into a workable format by first using the <code>as_tibble()</code> function to convert the list to a tibble (which has similar properties to a dataframe, <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html">find out more here</a>), and using the <code>unnest()</code> function on the new result:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>spacex_data &lt;- unnest(as_tibble(spacex_data))
# Show data:
spacex_data</code></pre>

<h3>thegraph (GRT)</h3>
<p>In the next section we will talk about how to leverage GraphQL to interact with “The Graph Network,” which allows us to interact with networks built on the Ethereum blockchain and IPFS.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-the-graph---grt" class="section level2">
<h2>the graph - GRT</h2>
<p>There are a large number of applications built on Ethereum (most being <a href="https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/383/what-is-a-dapp">“dapps,” meaning decentralized applications</a>), and because they are public blockchains, “the graph” project created a way for developers to make <em>“subgraphs”</em> that allow users to query data from smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain through GraphQL.</p>
<p>For example, a vibrant virtual world owned by its users is being built on the <a href="https://decentraland.org/">“Decentraland” blockchain</a>, and we can query information relating to things like real estate transactions using the Decentraland subgraph made available by the graph network:</p>
<iframe src="https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/decentraland/marketplace" width="624" height="400px">
</iframe>
<!-- There are tools for developers to build subgraphs on any Ethereum smart contract since anything on the Ethereum blockchain is publicly accessible. You can learn more about creating subgraphs at this link: https://thegraph.com/docs/introduction For the purposes of this tutorial -->
<div id="section-decentraland-subgraph-request" class="section level3">
<h3>Decentraland Subgraph Request</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, users can buy and sell digital real estate on Decentraland.</p>
<!-- Commented out because does not feel very relevant, might be better to add this as a fun note for the end indead - TODO -->
<!-- We own the digital real estate located at the coordinates (33, 6), which you can visit for yourself by accessing the location within the game: <https://play.decentraland.org/?position=33%2C6> -->
<!-- On a map here is what it looks like: -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- include_graphics("https://api.decentraland.org/v1/parcels/33/6/map.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- *The image above was displayed using the regular API created by Decentraland, you can find the documentation for it here (which is different from the GraphQL subgraph on the graph network): https://docs.decentraland.org/market/api/* -->
<!-- TODO - NOTE 12/29: SHOULD MAKE SCRIPT WHERE I FIND LATEST SOLD ESTATE, SHOW IT ON A MAP AND SHOW THE $ VALUE AFTER FIRST PULLING THE LATEST PRICE OF MANA! INCLUDE FILTERS DIRECTLY IN THE GRAPHQL QUERY TO ONLY RETURN VERY SPECIFICALLY THE URL OF THE ESTATE, AND THE SELLING PRICE, LIMITING TO 1 RESULT THAT WAS A SOLD ESTATE -->
<!-- NOTE 01/08: Perform the last step as described above and ready to publish and share the tutorial! -->
<p><strong>– WORK IN PROGRESS</strong></p>
<!-- TODO - HERE start by doing higher level analysis like for example figuring out the total MANA in the current market how much people are investing and using, and grabbing latest price of MANA to compare it to real $ dollars. Use pins data to analyze and create history over 5-7 days or something along those lines. -->
<!-- Pretty unrelated code below, so commented out: -->
<!-- ### Exercise -->
<!-- The code below can be used to retrieve the coordinates to the Predict Crypto HQ in Decentraland. -->
<!-- 1.  First, run the code to produce the same map as shown above for the coordinates (33, 6). Simply **press the green "Run Code" button to show the results**. -->
<!-- 2.  Then, change the url below to find the center of the map (0, 0) by replacing the numbers 33 and 6 in the link below with 0's. -->
<!-- ```{r show-map, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2} -->
<!-- include_graphics("https://api.decentraland.org/v1/parcels/33/6/map.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- ```{r show-map-hint} -->
<!-- include_graphics("https://api.decentraland.org/v1/parcels/0/0/map.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- A copy of the Predict Crypto HQ is also located at the coordinates (120, -21). Feel free to find it on the map using the interactive code chunk above, or navigate to the location inside the game itself: <https://play.decentraland.org/?position=120%2C-21> -->
<!-- You can access the Decentraland game itself below, or by clicking the link above and experiencing it in its own browser window. The url has the coordinates embedded into it, so you will be brought directly to the Predict Crypto HQ within Decentraland. -->
<!-- ```{r decentraland_embed, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- include_url('https://play.decentraland.org/?position=33%2C6',height = '550px') -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In case I need to remember syntax for a quiz: -->
<!-- ```{r quiz} -->
<!-- quiz( -->
<!--   question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?", -->
<!--     answer("base"), -->
<!--     answer("tools"), -->
